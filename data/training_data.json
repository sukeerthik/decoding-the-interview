        "text": "films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . \nfor starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . \nto say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . \nthe book ( or \" graphic novel , \" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . \nin other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . \nif you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . \ngetting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? \nthe ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . \nit's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called \" unfortunates \" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . \nwhen the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . \nabberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . \nupon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach . \ni don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . \nin the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . \nit's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . \nand from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( \" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? \" ) . \ndon't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . \nnow onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . \nthe print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . \noscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place . \neven the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . \nians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham . \ni cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad . \nthe film , however , is all good . \n2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content \n",

        "text": "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \nmtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \nthe plot is deceptively simple . \ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \nand paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \nyou can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \nthe similarities are staggering : \ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe even gets a bee sting . \nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \nhe gets several bee stings . \nand so on . \nwhat happened ? \nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ? \neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . \nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then . \nwitherspoon is a revelation . \nit's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \nand once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over . \none thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it . \nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \neven so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \nthere's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \n",

        "text": "you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to . \nin order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . \nno real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . \nessentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . \nit's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . \nbut oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . \nbut there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . \nit couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . \ni haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ? \nif you like something so much , why even question it ? \nagain , the storyline is as cliched as they come . \ntom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . \nfox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . \nlittle do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity . \nthe rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . \nsure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . \nall of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . \nbut as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . \nwhen ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling . \n",

        "text": " \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . \ndah-dum . \nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . \nhe's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \nhe doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . \n \" it's your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \nhe's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \nof course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \nevery one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \nmany have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \n",

        "text": "on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \npatrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \nlumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's . \n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life . \nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona . \nthe family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \n",

        "text": "apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \nvisually , the film is very powerful . \nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \n",

        "text": "one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding . \nand she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . \nher reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . \nbut the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film . \nand while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . \nwritten and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . \nalda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . \nas bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . \nwalsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . \nringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . \nshe looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits . \nshe's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . \nand to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance . \nthankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . \nthe wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . \nringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . \nwalsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . \nwhen the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" \nally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises . \nsheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . \nit's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . \nlapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . \nlapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot . \nand what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . \nlapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off . \ni don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . \nthe scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . \njoe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . \nalda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . \nthe film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . \nas a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . \nand while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy . \n",

        "text": "after watching \" rat race \" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes . \nsaturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first . \n \" rat race \" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness . \nhands down , this is the most fun film of the summer . \nthe movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen . \nthen comes the setup . \ndonald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients . \nto that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines . \ngathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , \" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . \" \nthe competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash . \nthere is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead . \nthe race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money . \nsince it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers . \ndecked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby . \nshe finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life . \nthrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature . \nowen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america . \nan nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game . \nafter escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . \nmr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america . \nhe also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times . \npollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation . \nrandy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas . \nfearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview . \nbeverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert . \nbrothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid . \nblaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him . \nthe boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . \nfinally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey . \nat first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . \ndirector jerry zucker ( \" airplane , \" \" ghost \" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers . \nas with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps . \nhigh points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . \nhad i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron . \nit would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation . \ni also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence . \nmy god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing \" all star ? \" \nbut enough carping . \n \" rat race \" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast . \nsee it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for . \n",

        "text": "the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice . \nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \nwhat if he's also able to think on his feet ? \nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator . \nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office . \ni don't quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \nalthough it wouldn't surprise me if he did . \nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \nalthough roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \nhow can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability . \nalmost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \nhis is an interesting character . \nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \ngray really lucked out with this cast . \ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \nfortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality . \nwe're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \nas an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film . \nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \n",

        "text": "the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \nthis developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced . \ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \nthe film only gets better from this point . \nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless . \n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army . \neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun . \nconnery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed . \nandy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer . \nas ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him . \ncharles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone . \nsmith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film . \nthe action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen . \nalso very similar to \" the matrix , \" they are exciting and intense . \n>from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed . \nthe score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement . \nits pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors . \nthe combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective . \nalthough the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . \nsome scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid . \n",

' \n`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) . \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators . \nalso bob hoskins' performance should be credited . \nhe , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars . \naccording to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off . \n`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film . \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . \ndo yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . \" \n",

        "text": "the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages . \nmartin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime . \nunfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies . \nseventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . \nthis film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s . \ngoodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) . \nthe book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york . \nat the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands . \nafter couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) . \nthree of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history . \nwealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business . \nbut the perfect world of \" wiseguys \" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends . \ngoodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory . \nscorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker . \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating . \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny . \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens . \nscorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience . \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era . \neven if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker . \nfirst , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue . \nthen , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards . \nthis multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation . \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack . \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s . \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed . \nhowever , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people . \nsuch scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s . \nfragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese . \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious \" a day in life \" segment near the end of the film . \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents . \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues . \njoe pesci deserved his \" oscar \" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film . \nray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film . \nliotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs . \nliotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction . \nlorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband . \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave . \nas a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time . \nbecause of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s . \n",

        "text": " \" the blair witch project \" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . \nits success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . \nafter the release of \" the blair witch project \" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . \nlocals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , \" get out of these woods and go home ! \nthere is no goddamned blair witch ! \" . \njeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . \nafter he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . \nas the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the \" blair witch hunt \" . \namong the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called \" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? \" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . \nthe last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying \" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . \" \nthis strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . \non the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening . \nwhen they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . \nafter a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . \nthey are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . \nthey are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality . \nthe only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . . \ndocumentary director joe berlinger ( \" paradice lost \" ) helms \" blair witch 2 \" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . \nthe opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . \nbut soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . \nin a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . \nmore money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . \nthe horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated . \nof course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . \nfrom its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with \" the blair witch project \" . \n \" blair witch . . \" \nwas filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . \nin the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . \nwith its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . \nand though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . \nthe key is simplicity . \n \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . \nthat allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . \nthe film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . \nthe effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \n \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . \nhere , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \" clever \" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . \nthere is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with . \nthis is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor . \nit resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed . \nbut most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original . \nin the end , i can't call it a bad effort . \nit's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad . \nit's simply different . \nin fact , if you haven't seen \" the blair witch project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . \nthe only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . \nbut it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . \nto me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . \nand it's already time to look forward to \" blair witch 3 \" . \n",

        "text": "seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . \none of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . \nwith some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . \nthere's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \n",

\" . \nwings of desire this ain't . \nsince debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors . \n ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . ) \nhis no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another . \ndogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition . \nas well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever . \nany movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack . \na long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough . \nbecause his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time . \nsure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated . \nlike tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker . \ndogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes ! \nsmith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan \" catholicism wow ! \" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished . \ni bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions . \nproceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever . \nit's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma . \nthe prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy . \nthere's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against . \n ( not one of them had watched it . ) \nevery single person refused . \nsmith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith . \nin fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster . \n ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to . \nnow that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through . \nit's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins . \nmy religion is movies . \nwhen the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid . \ni therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers . \n",

! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman . \nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film . \ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \nfor example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \na lot of the movie is like that . \nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . . \nbecause he doesn't do much to add to it in any way . \nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \nwhat's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \nthere's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \noddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \nwell , he's done a good job . \nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \nthat's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \nthat's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film . \nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \nhis explanation ? \n \" his future is clouded . \" \n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \nenter at your own risk . ) \nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \ndid this story need to be told ? \ni would say no . \nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \nabsolutely . \nif you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \nabove all , this is a fun movie . \nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \nbut fun . \nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \n : ) \n",

        "text": "as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film . \nthe shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars . \nto see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film . \nas a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin . \nthe bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . \nthis one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds . \nit perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film . \n \" in the heat of the night \" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america . \njewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental . \nin these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers . \nhe is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present . \npreceding the very original \" a soldier's story \" and the recently released \" the hurricane , \" \" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters . \nthe film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted . \ntibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him . \nas a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist . \npoitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character . \nnever nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing . \nhowever , unlike \" the hurricane \" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance . \nas a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role . \nhe starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople . \nhe would refer to tibbs as \" boy \" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him . \nas the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff . \nhe begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors . \nwhat i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film . \nhe still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil . \ninstead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future . \nmost movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes . \nthis action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day . \njewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate . \n \" in the heat of the night \" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's . \nit displays this perfectly . \nhowever , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest . \nit seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . \nthere were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) . \nalso , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered . \nthe rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic . \n ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson . \nhe managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , \" in the heat of the night \" and the even better \" in cold blood . \" ) \n",

        "text": "in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's . \nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \nyou'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \nin wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful . \nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \nhe's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants . \nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \nhe's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm . \nand maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \ni'm privy to films about literary types i . e . \nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often . \nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \nit's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \n",

        "text": "the event of events is upon us . \npeople have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it . \ni don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused . \nit is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history . \nanyone who tells you \" it's just a movie \" is either lying or clueless . \nit is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic . \nthe second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated . \nbut that does not mean that the film itself is bad . \nin fact , it is terrific . \ni strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash . \nit is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place . \nthe film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo . \nthe republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as \" the force \" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate . \nunable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene . \non the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . \nhe is an innocent slave boy , but \" the force is strong with him \" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi . \nas any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker . \n>from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie . \naround 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul . \ni think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this . \nthis is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks . \nhe's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like \" exqueeze me ? \" \nand \" mesa go now , okeday ? \" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying . \nthe visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph . \nif it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement . \nthe climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term \" popcorn movie \" . \nwhat made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams . \neven though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant . \nhis use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling . \nthe phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia . \nwhen you see \" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away \" , when the familiar music plays , when the words \" star wars \" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 . \nit feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side . \nit is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not . \nwe not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years . \nthe phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars . \nit works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia . \n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \n",

time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees . \nannette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career . \ncarolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy . \nunable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder . \nms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone . \nthe slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words . \nthora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her . \njane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment . \nher growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning . \nshe is the prototypical trophy child . \nwhen carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( \" i'm so proud of you , honey . \nyou didn't screw up once ! \" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable . \nthora birch is a young actress to watch . \npraise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance . \ncolonel finn is a man in complete denial . \nhis military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend . \nwes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma . \nthe boy next door who may be more foe than friend . \na deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him . \nmr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film . \nthat is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it . \ndirector sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle . \nscenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character . \nthe subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) . \nevery nuance of \" american beauty \" begs it's audience to think and examine . \nit is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come . \nand well it should , as it is simply one of this years best . \n",

        "text": "if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \nso when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \nit's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \nfine performances are turned in all around . \nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy . \nfor daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \nthere's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't . \n",

        "text": "`we run tings . \ntings don't run we . ' \n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \n",

        "text": "at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds . \nthat's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) . \nbut home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way . \nthe mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays . \nfour adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse . \nthe littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty . \nkevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve . \nhe attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him . \nthe fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle . \nthe knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin . \nnobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back . \nthe ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night . \non his way up the stairs , he tells her that \" families suck \" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again . \nthat night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport . \nin a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him . \nit's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . \nfirst they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class . \nthey're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child . \nmeanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true . \nhe's finally rid of his family ! \nlife is a dream come true . \nhe can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box . \nslowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane . \nhe grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( \" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener \" ) . \nhe also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring . \nthe furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house . \nmacaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor . \nstill , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing . \nfor example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as \" santa \" is getting in his car . \nkevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . \nhe learned how to deal with the furnace . \nyou turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore . \nhe goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man . \nthey talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid . \nfinally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) . \nthis last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert . \nit's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie . \non the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie . \njohn williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . \nbut it does have its flaws . \nthe smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well . \nas i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character . \nthe biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times . \ninstead of \" i'm gonna get that kid \" they say \" i'm gonna kill that kid . \" \nsome might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree . \nmixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas . \ni'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year . \ndon't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick . \n",

        "text": "-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass -- \nsummary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! \nto premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . \nhe hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . \nwe see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . \nquick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . \nthe mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . \nunlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . \nthe makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . \nthe performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . \nso i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . \nlonger , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers] \nthe primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . \ntoo many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . \nyou watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you . \nmatinee is not like that . \ni left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . \ni found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . \nbut most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . \nthe comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . \ni believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . \nhe is highly expressive both physically and vocally . \ni felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . \nthe other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film . \nthe movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . \ni thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . \nthey tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . \nunfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . \nwhile the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . \nseveral aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . \none example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . \nif you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here . \nanother reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . \none of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . \n ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) \nwhile mant ! \nnever got made , many films like it were , and mant ! \nserves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . \nso again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . \nthis isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way . \nenjoy ! \n",

        "text": "earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent . \npeople who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee . \nthe story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves . \nthe action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta . \nshanta has a small circle of male admirers . \ntwo of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim . \nthe others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das . \n ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . ) \nin an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears . \none of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along . \nhe is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism . \nthe tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses . \nit is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter . \nthe group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together . \nbut the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state . \na sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees . \nanother man is murdered . \nthe group of friends will not meet again . \nthe movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles . \nit is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully . \nthe crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz . \nhis sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim . \ndil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him . \nbut she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer . \nthe combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate . \ndespite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things . \nthe conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt . \nthe story earth tells does not end . \nit just stops . \nit is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction . \nbut there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades . \nsince the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus . \nthere is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) . \nearth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie . \nit does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas . \nbut deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep . \nearth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history . \nsuch films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . \nthey may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack . \nit is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve . \nthe issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year . \nin the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other . \nat the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding . \n",

        "text": "i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . \nthis was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . \nnot only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . \nthe very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . \ngibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . \ngibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . \nthe character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . \ntry to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups . \nif you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher . \nin many ways , i was surprised by this movie . \nto begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . \ndon't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . \nsecondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance . \nhe provided a fantastic performance . \nthe previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . \ngibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . \nfor instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . \nand last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . \nwriter brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions . \nmel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film . \njulia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . \nhe also seems obsessed and in love with her . \nbut whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . \njerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . \nalthough he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . \nvery soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . \nafter barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . \nthe remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy . \nand more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life . \nmany things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . \nfor instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . \nlee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . \nmake sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . \ndefinitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . \ni am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . \nand even if you aren't , you should still like this film . \n",

        "text": "the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \nfor adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \nbut first the basics . \nbased very loosely on a 1990 children's story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \nhe proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! \" ) \nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that'll do , donkey . \nthat'll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \nbut the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it's a small world . \" \nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \nhere's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \nput the past behind you ! \nthere's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms ! \nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \nit's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature . \ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \nadding short jokes is simply mean . \nstill , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \nto trot out a clich ? , \" shrek \" is fun for all ages . \nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \n",

        "text": "after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again . \nthere is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice . \n \" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , \" he says , \" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' \" \nof course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety . \nyou begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience . \nexperiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts . \ntrust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point . \njuzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan . \na stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) . \ngoro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious . \ngoro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen . \nthe problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing . \nhowever , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy . \nthis film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems . \ntake , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner . \nthe price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum . \ntampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room . \nshe protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists . \njust when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door . \nshe peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience . \nthis scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery . \nthere's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers . \nwe even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet . \nthe scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all . \nthere are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives . \na particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor . \nsurrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life . \nher husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner . \nthe viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this . \nin a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family . \nas the family eats , she looks on them and smiles . \npreparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy . \nthen she falls over , dead . \nfor a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , \" keep eating ! \nthis is the last meal your mother ever made ! \" \ncrying as they do so , the family finishes the meal . \nthe scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful . \nby including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline . \ninstead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble . \nbecause the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the \" good guys \" come together for the final showdown . \nin this case , the showdown is against the ramen . \nif they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded . \nit's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack . \n",

        "text": "why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \ntoo many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \nrealizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger . \nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience . \nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \nit's very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate . \nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon . \nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \nthe characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) . \ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \nthe film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \nit's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \nthe film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \nit's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \n",

        "text": "roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor . \nhowever the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made , and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed . \nmaximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) . \nproximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself ) , and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator . \nwhen emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum , proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle . \nmaximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus . \ngladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required \" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence \" style of moviemaking . \nthe only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . . \nit's choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting . \nit's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective . \nthe actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed . \nmany times it's unclear as to exactly what's going on . . . \nall the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled . \nwe're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though . \nthere's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing . \nit's comes when maximus escapes his executioners . \nsome flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . . \nbut i still don't know exactly how he did it . \nrussell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity . \nfor whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . . \nbut he should have it now . \nfrom here on moviegoers should now be able to say , \" let's go see the new russell crowe movie \" . \nhe gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum . \nit's both rousing and chilling . \njoaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) . \ncommodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny , but phoenix never lets the character get silly . \nit's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance . \noliver reed died during the filming of gladiator , and it's a huge loss to the acting world . \ni've always been fascinated with reed . . . \nhe's one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years . \nit's ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again , as he gives a fun and sincere performance . \nthe film is dedicated to him , and he will surely be missed . \nreed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem , as he still had scenes to be completed . \nrather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) , a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars . \nironically , that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film . \nanyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you aren't looking for it you won't even be able to tell . \nsome of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . . \nand like i always say , noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately . \nit's sad that such a good film has these distractions . \nmovies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects . \nkeep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction . \nhowever it's a work of fiction that's great entertainment , and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d . \n",

\nshortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . \nthis is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives . \ngranted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . \ni think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . \nbenigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . \nbenigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . \nit = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . \nthere are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . \nslapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed . \nand although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . \nthis is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . \nthe second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . \nguido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . \nfor = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . \nfor his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds . \nwhich raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? \nwith persecution ? \nwith injustice on the worst level ? \nit+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had . \nother times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . \nsometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . \nbenigni+s guido realizes this . \nhe is the clown , but he is not a fool . \nhe sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . \nhis liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him . \nit+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . \nperhaps that is a form of denial . \nperhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) . \nor . . . \nperhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit . \nwhatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . \nsurprisingly , it works . \nit is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . \nit+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . \nthey don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more . \ni believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . \nhowever , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . \nbenigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . \nhe has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . \nit swept the italian academy awards . \ncontroversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . \nmasterful . \nmiraculous . \na must-see . \n",

the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe . \npullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious . \nben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny . \n \" i'll shoot you , \" he says to stark at one point . \n \" i have a gun , and everything . \" \nhis character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job . \no'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs . \ni find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film . \nkasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) . \nit's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times . \nthere's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective . \nwhat we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular . \ni can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero . \nas a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa . \nthere was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it . \ni have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest . \njake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old . \ni found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker . \nhis direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed . \nzero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul . \nat the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome . \nand , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future . \n",

        "text": "screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . \nscreenplay by andrew kevin walker . \ninspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . \ndirected by tim burton . \nstarring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . \nspecial appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . \nsynopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . \ntownspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . \ncute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . \ncomments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . \nbatman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . \nhe's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . \nsleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . \nsleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . \nchristopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . \nthe movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . \none of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . \ni mention these allusions for a reason . \nseasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . \nwith the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . \nnot only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . \nthe film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . \njohnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator . \ndepp is adequate in his role . \nno more ; no less . \nequally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . \nshe's a good witch too . \nhow cute . \none of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . \nthe two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . \nveteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . \nwhile i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . \nyou have to pay attention . \nandrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . \nhe's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . \nwalker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation . \nas one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . \nthere's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . \nthis is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . \na lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand . \nhe was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence . \nif you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended . \n",

        "text": "mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it's just about time . \nfor over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \ni'm not entirely sure why , exactly . \nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \nthey're quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \nat the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but \nafter having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . ) \n \" drunken master \" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \nafter embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \nthen , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \nit's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \nwhether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and \nit's often as funny as anything , too . \nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \nthere's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \nbut they're still hilarious as ever . \nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \ni'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \nit apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it . \ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on . \ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's \nnot just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn't . \nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \nit's much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \nyou might very well like it . \nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if \nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) . \nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there . \nall in all , i give this film an . \n",

        "text": "logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \nconsidering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \nterry gilliam's \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \nbut more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all . \nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \nyes . \ndoes it matter ? \nnot really . \nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day . \nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \nthis isn't explained ; you just have to go with it . \nwhen frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \nsometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point . \nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film . \nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors . \nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john . \nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \nperhaps the only thing i didn't like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \nbut that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \nwho wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \nor see how their children turn out ? \n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \nand don't call me a sissy . \n",

        "text": "since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows . \nmost of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \nthat's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia . \nit's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \nthe mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here . \nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm . \nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father . \nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \nher role is instantly likeable . \nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \nhe's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \nalthough it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \nit's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \n",

        "text": "after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \nthe charisma of the two leads ? \neven now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \ni don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such . \nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \nit was traditional , magical . \nwe knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction . \nfrom the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet . \nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \nreal people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice . \nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence . \nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes . \nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we're concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \ndisappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart . \nwe already know that there's going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won't do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \nit shows . \nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn't imagined . \n",

\nthe movie was beautifully and sensitively made . \ndirector michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred . \nthey show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with . \nthis is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended . \nthe group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities . \none of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth . \nlike the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live . \nwinterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room . \nthe picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics . \nwinterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities . \nthis portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com \nselection mad city . \nwe watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached . \nhowever , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out . \nstephen dillane is wonderful as henderson . \nhe portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events . \ndillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy . \nhenderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few . \nit is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea . \nwoody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation . \nharrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through . \nharrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one . \nthis ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career . \namerica's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place . \nfor those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson . \nwar is a foreign concept to most of us in america . \nbattles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to . \ntelevised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war . \nthis picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america . \n",

        "text": "many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . \nwhile possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . \nthere is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . \nstephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . \nhe is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . \neven the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . \nin the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . \ncamille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . \nmaxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . \nlike stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . \nwhen stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . \nhowever , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . \nstephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . \nas the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . \nthese two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . \nstephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . \nhowever , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . \nthe audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . \nhowever , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . \nconsequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . \nin contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . \nhowever , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . \nduring the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . \nstephane attempts to remain unchanged . \nhowever , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . \none of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . \nthe development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . \namerican movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . \nin its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . \nthe portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters . \ni am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" \nthis movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . \ni find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . \nthis portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . \nunfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters . \nwhile ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . \nthe synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . \nthe directing in this movie is wonderful . \nthe actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . \nemmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful . \nand needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . \nbesides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . \ni almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . \nthe one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? \ni have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . \nin summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . \nin the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . \nin itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . \nwhere it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . \ni do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . \nhowever , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . \ni would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it . \n",

' \nthe elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught . \nhe has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune . \nalways the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail . \nthis involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis . \nwhen he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke . \nnow a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home . \ncarol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him . \nshe's a very bright person with a good heart . \nyet , her life is a miserable waste of time . \nthe most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars . \nher days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics . \nworse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) . \nthey became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom . \nto her , this made sense long ago . \nbut now , it's a different story . \nwayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put . \nwayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman . \ncarol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life . \nhowever , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change . \nthe medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke . \ncarol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all . \nmaybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away . \nthe opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . ' \nand what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ? \nperhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . \nif that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below . \nwhen he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining . \ncarol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness . \nshe is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy . \nthis , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation . \nhenry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car . \nhenry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash . \nmeanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life . \nwayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless . \nhowever , his lack of commitment threatens their success . \nthe heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong . \n`where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist . \nnewman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff . \nhe possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive . \nfiorentino is also a fun presence . \nyou root for her despite her sense of amorality . \nsure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic . \nwith two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is . \n",

        "text": "call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he's taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting . \nthere's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n",

        "text": "call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \nthat's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \nthey haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree . \nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \nain't they a pair ? \nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \nby the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \naberdeen doesn't know where else to go . \nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \nheadey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \nit's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs & wonders . \nit's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \ndespite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \nthere's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \nnossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama . \naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \n",

        "text": "best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter , scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on . \nusually playing a bit role in some studio schlock ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) , he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do . \nif you want to see some brilliant acting , check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda . \ncox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . , which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . \nbig john feels the love that dares not speak its name , but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad . \nwhat bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light . \nhe's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems ( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) \nhe'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world . \nl . i . e . stands for long island expressway , which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia . \nfilmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) . \nin his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . \nhighway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 . \nhe's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . , and those feelings are projected onto big john ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do . \nthis makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) \nl . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven . \nthere is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime , degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . \nrather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) , these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length . \nconcurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted . \ncox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster . \ndano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent . \nwe're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) , it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene . \nthe restraint is admirable . \nbut l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material . \nwhen howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious . \ndirector michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john , who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations . \nit's too much . \nthere are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie . \nthis plot thread predictably leads to violence . \nnot content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) , cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note . \nit's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet , sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note . \nin this regard , l . i . e . \n ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films : problems are solved when the obstacle is removed . \nhow often does real life work this way ? \nto extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ? \n",

        "text": "a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \nfirst , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \nno no . . . \njust kidding . \nhad you going there for a moment , didn't i ? \nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) . \nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \ni'd even go so far as to say that many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn't try to overachieve . \nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \nshao khan has decided that he's going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \ntoo bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \n * the acting is truly bad . \nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he's so totally wrong for this part that he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \n . . . unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \n * there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \nsilly , silly folks . \nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \nyou'll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \n",

        "text": " \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \nit's not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he's a great director and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \nand it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \nit's worse than that . \nit's aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \nthere's a big name in the crowd , and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who's sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \ndiscovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness' takes on what happened . \nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . then \nit takes one wrong step . \nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \nbut that's not the worst part of it : it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn't think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting . \nit's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \nthat's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \nthis time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \nwhat went wrong ? \ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \nthen there's koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life like he did in depalma's earlier \" carlito's way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \nhe's flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn't so formulaic . \na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he'd be given , and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe . \nnow there's a film . \nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \n",

        "text": "forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects . \nset in 1692 at salem , massachusetts , the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon . \nthey beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells . \nthen one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes . \nnot to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) , abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood . \ntaking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? \nsurely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ? \nthe crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play . \nthis is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale . \nthe play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere . \nin the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box . \nnot only is credulity stretched but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted . \nit positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot . \nnot surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning , witches are invoked by those eager to blame . \nwhen the girls are questioned , their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail . \nwith alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents , constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion . \nabigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft . \nappropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched . \ndirector nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour with shots where we stare up at proctor as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . \notherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable . \nryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings . \nher fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful . \nabigail supposedly revels in her newfound power , but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty although there is much haughtiness to spare here . \npaul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth , but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves . \nprobably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing , allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character . \na scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . \nunfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one his urge to pontificate returns and the human urgency of his situation is lost . \nit is clear that miller meant well but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions . \nhis screenplay is an imperfect creature with the distractions coming out as loud as the message . \nthe result is a clumsy muddle - i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable . \nwhen the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed . \nfar from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience . \n",

        "text": "reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) . \nthe guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : \" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel \" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) . \nhis screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight . \ni can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , \" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! \" \nit's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie . \nand why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ? \nauteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's \" style \" , not the director's that winds up on screen . \nkruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut \" sometimes less is more \" . \nand his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the \" character \" . . . grammar \nbe damned ) . \n \" how did you know that ? \" \nthe stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along . \n . \n . \nsince twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently . \nhe's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects . \nthis is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles . \ntheir company's current logo could be \" we ride the trends \" . \nreindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head . \nalthough affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick . \naffleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch . \nthe role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent \" serious \" movie getting . \nit may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance ) \njames frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) . \nashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him . \nwhich works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts . \nhe plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino . \nthough by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant . \nthis is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner . \nincluded : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) . \nthough it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience . \nthe flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up . \nit would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau \n ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this . \nhe films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart . \nproblem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . \ncharacter problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off . \nthe former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear . \nbut then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster . \ncharlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next . \nshe never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this . \ngary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat . \nthese are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience . \n",

        "text": "some movies i should just skip . \nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon . \nbut it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \nturns out i was right , mostly . \ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn't just business , it's a way of life . \nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \n \" let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \n \" ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \n \" what does this scene do ? \ncharacter depth ? \nbut where's the zaniness ? \ni don't see zany here . \nif you can't make it zany , cut it ! \" \nthe latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie . \nmichelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in , but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . \nmy guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor . \ndabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby . \ni kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film , but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes . \nhe is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the \" gidget bitch from hell \" town mayor . \noteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that i had to wonder if the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town . \nor , maybe all career politicians are like that . \ni must say , matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget as he did godzilla . \nhe appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget . \nrupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw . \njoely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself . \nher performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film . \nd . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick , in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years . \nthe dialog is . . . let's face it , it's pretty bad . \nthe tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas that makes no sense in context . \na lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib . \nabout three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw . \ngadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really \" battles \" ) with the evil gadget . \npenny does about a minute and a half of the detective work her character did every week in the cartoon . \nlet me rage here just for a minute . \nmichelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character . \nshe's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective . \nwhy she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery . \nthe film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity . \ninspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable , but it's a very short movie , so perhaps something was cut at the last moment . \nprobably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits . \nthe \" evil sidekick support group \" is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen . \nall in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films . \ni wonder if disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers . \nbut if true , why ? \nif they're trying for another mary poppins , they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it . \n",

        "text": "hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell . \nthe last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . \nin a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . \nwith the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions . \nsuch talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . \nnow we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . \nunfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms . \nthe film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . \nenter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . \nkai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family . \na battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . \nit's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . \nthe following morning po sing is found dead . \nsuspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . \nhis concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . \nissac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . \nthe scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . \nhe fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . \nhung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . \nescaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death . \n \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . \nit is both absurd and assured . \nthe basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . \nthe relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . \ntheir romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . \nthe performances are adequate if not fully acceptable . \nli , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . \nallayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . \nit's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . \nbut , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it . \ndelro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . \nan unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . \nthe other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin . \nthe performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . \nan unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . \nfirst time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . \nhaving a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . \nbut the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . \nthe script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in . \nthe big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . \nand of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever . \nthe best things about the film are its fight scenes . \njet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . \none needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . \nhere , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow . \nunfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . \nalso \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . \nobviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . \nit's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . \none problem though about the fight scenes . \nthose that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . \nthey do have an internal rhythm to them . \na heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . \nthe fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . \nthis is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . \nhere in \" romeo must die \" , there is no staccato . \nevery fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . \nthe rhythm is monotonous . \na hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . \n'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever . \na fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . . \nwatch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) . \nnow look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . \nthere you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath . \nthe stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . \nhere in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl . \njet li is a grand and personable screen presence . \nit's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here . \none day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . \nuntil then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" .

        "text": "talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters ! \nspice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls . \nit's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch . \nwhen watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name . \nthe spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented . \nthere's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat . \nthe film itself doesn't really have a plot . \nit follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their \" first live performance \" at albert hall . \nthe action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas . \nthe various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even \nwhen they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . \nwhew . \nfor some reason , the film is littered with star cameos . \nfrom elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf . \nheck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld . \nrichard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford . \nthe celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film . \nneither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring . \ntheir songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos . \nmy advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either \noption will be more enjoyable than the film . \nnon-fans should know to stay well away from this one . \n",

        "text": "one of the responses those that enjoy \" detroit rock city \" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : \" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . \njust what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? \" \ni'm wondering the same thing . \ni feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" \nit's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't . \ni just didn't . \nsurely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ? \nno , but i expected something . \na funny joke . \na clever prank . \na plot development . \nanything . \nthe movie never delivers . \nyou've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \n \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization . \nthe film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . \nthat's it . \nthere is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot . \nthe characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . \nthey have a garage band . \nthey're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . \nthey have tickets , they lose them . \nthey get more tickets , they lose those too . \nthey come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . \nthere's not much more to it . \nfrankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . \noh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . \nshe doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already . \nit's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . \nwe've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . \nthen again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \n \" detroit rock city \" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . \nin fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . \nbasically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) . \nit's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . \nedward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood . \npeople wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . \ntoo bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess . \ndirector adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . \nwe get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . \nit's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . \ni would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing on this baby . \ni haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since \" armageddon . \" \nand what about that script ? \nit's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard . \nif it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible . \na plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . \nthe jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . \nin fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal . \nthe rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it \" comedy . \" \nthere is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up . \nit's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , \" see ? \nfunny ! \" \nlook , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver . \ntwice . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \nlook , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money . \nsee ? \nfunny ! \na word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves . \nthey must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . \nthat's it , i've said enough about this movie . \nit's a waste of time and money . \ni liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack . \ni hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie . \nyou want to see this concept executed well ? \ngo rent roger corman's 1979 classic \" rock n' roll high school . \" \nit features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show . \nyes , go rent that , and skip \" detroit rock city , \" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so . \n",

' \nthe year is 3000 . \nmankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) . \na small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below . \nthe psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver . \na young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . ' \nhe is promptly captured and taken to the alien base . \nafter several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end . \njonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use . \nthen the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet . \nthe whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits . \nroger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . \nand decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth . \nchristian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie ! \nand every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really . \nthe psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit . \ntravolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect . \njonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! ' \nthen there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve . \nwhy ? \nbecause terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid .

        "text": " \" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . \" \nthis quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning . \ndirector david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge . \nwith crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out . \nthis just goes to show that hype kills . \nit's very rare that a film so hyped up as \" fight club \" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception . \nthe story goes like this . \nedward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) . \nnorton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended . \napparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain . \nwhy any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse . \nnorton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) . \nthe two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight . \nhow do they come up with this stuff ? \nanyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed . \nout of all this mess , there manages to lie a message . \nfincher shows us that society is like robots . \nwe work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out . \nour insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others . \ncall me crazy , but this is common knowledge . \ni think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably . \neven with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story . \ni couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp . \nit just shows how desperate the script is for attention . \ni guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself . \nhis bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee . \nit only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more . \nhelena bonham carter however really had no purpose . \nshe just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left . \nthis continues for what seems like 6 hours . \nthe film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while \" fight club \" nears what i think might be the end . \nunfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom . \nthough the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace . \non a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer . \nfincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson . \nconcentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support . \nalso , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence . \nthe last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . \nwhen the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil . \nyou'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says \" this is so f * * * ing stupid . \" \n",

\nthey require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid . \n ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) \nhilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it . \nwe trust nasa to build space shuttles ? ) \nharry assembles the obligatory \" ragtag \" bunch of \" cowboys \" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) . \nonce they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes . \nwhether or not they save the day , i will not reveal . \nnor will you care . \ni will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope . \nwillis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck . \ntheir big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material . \nsteve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic . \n \" rockhound \" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film . \nso why did they bring him up there to begin with ? \nrather , why write him into the film ? -give \nhis almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig . \ni'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue . \nliv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( \" aerosmith \" ) songs grace the soundtrack . \ndirector michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen . \n ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . ) \nwhenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out \" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! \" \ni must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood . \narmageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla . \nit looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework . \nit has a vivid soundmix . \nbut at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story . \nthe love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever . \nbollocks ! \nthe lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler . \nremember a little film called jaws ? \nin this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark . \nthey didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another . \none of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories . \nthis is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end . \nnot once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before \" action \" was called . \na male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery . \nto this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse . \nand if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life . \n",

        "text": "susan granger's review of \" the watcher \" ( universal ) \njust what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga . \nthis time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd . \nto taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too . \nbefore long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again . \nin the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in \" the cell . \" \nwriters david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop \" need each other to give meaning to our lives . \" \nplus , as reeves explains , \" we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . \" \nafter that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack . \njames spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't . \nchris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the watcher \" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it . \n",

        "text": "over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . \npartly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . \na year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . \nas godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . \nthirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . \nnow it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . \nin emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . \nwhen the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . \nmeanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter . \nshe'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . \nof course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . \ntogether they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . \nwith the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . \nhe didn't . \nright up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . \nthe plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . \nthe script , however , is painfully bad . \nit's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" \ni suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . \nwhy is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? \nwhy do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? \nwhy do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? \nwhy is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? \nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \nhank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \nlike broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color . \nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past . \nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? \nif we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them . \ngodzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be . \nfar be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city ! \nthere's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . \njoe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time . \nin a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . \nnone of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . \nit's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . \nconsider another punch pulled . \nthrough creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently . \nit made me want to gag . \nemmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film . \nwith an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . \nhowever , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work . \nnow if they only had raymond burr . . . . \n",

        "text": "i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days . \nfor the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . \nsuch films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . \nthe biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . \nthe klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . \nsherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . \njanet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . \nwith love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . \nwith some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker . \nbut one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . \nbecause every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . \nthen the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . \nand did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? \nthe movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . \npure and simple , the klumps is a failure . \nits script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . \nany sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . \nit's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . \nhey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . \nthe characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . \neveryone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . \nthe grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . \nthe father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . \nthe mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . \nthe brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . \nsherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . \nbut the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . \nthe family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . \nand you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time . \nthe sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . \nafter a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . \nits also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . \neven the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . \nnow that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . \npeople will be lined up around the block for it . \nthe studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . \neddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie . \ni just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself . \n",

        "text": "lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects . \nafter the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' \nopening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game . \nthe plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade . \nhowever , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . ) \nthey also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) \nstar wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters . \nthe script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic . \nthe trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent . \nthere's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is . \nthe film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help . \nthere's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod . \nthe script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother . \nthere's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen . \nthe two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it . \nqui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for . \nthe audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time . \nmaul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . ) \nanakin is annoying and unlikeable . , \ninstead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended . \nit's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible . \nthe comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him . \nalthough his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny . \nthe only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while . \nqueen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin . \nagain , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here . \nthe actors don't help the movie much either . \nliam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible . \nmcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm . \nthe casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it . \nnatalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance . \nand jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice . \nthere's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there . \nhe's not even very 'cute . ' \nthe main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay . \nthere's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well . \nthe cgi takes away much of the human element , however . \nthe battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers . \nepisode 1 is just disappointing . \nit's got high production values , but little else . \nthe music is meandering , except near the end . \nthe plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for . \nthe effects are nice , but dull . \nthe plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should . \nthere's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film . \napart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film . \ndisappointing is barely the word . \nrating= \n",

        "text": "tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \nit's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \nart ! \" ) , \nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \nbecause we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas . \nthey're not real , sympathetic , or believable . \ni'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) . \nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious . \nfor everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \n",

\nadd onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night . \nsome gore . \ndon't bring children to this one . \ndon't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped . \nblech . \n . no fun whatsoever . \nmeier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled \nthis film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money . \nhis uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans . \nmeier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany . \nafter a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany . \nof course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there . \nthe humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) . \nstill , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny . \nc -- $2 . 50 . \nthe right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements \nafter a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to : \n1 ) be wary of french comedies . \nthese people like jerry lewis . \n2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait . \n3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as \" old pouty-lips \" is probably not worth watching . \n4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out ! \naustralia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task . \nwell , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards . \nit's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses . \nlots and lots of horses . \nthe film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir . \nunfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident . \nhighlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) . \nthe photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway . \nactually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life . \ngrade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks . \n",

'' \nas he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors . \nthe race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human . \nwhile , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community . \nwe also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations . \nthe film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work . \nthere are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being \" macks \" and \" players \" or \" real pimps \" and \" perpetrator pimps , \" but no further clarity is attempted . \nit is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word . \nthe film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame . \nthe only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to . \ndanny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe . \nwhile a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer . \n",

        "text": "another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like \" waking ned devine , \" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line . \nit is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin . \nthe strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol . \nthe film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas . \nbut its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message . \nits message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia . \nthe drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply . \nbillions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country . \neverything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war . \nthe film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never . \nthere has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether . \nthe film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide . \nthe widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined . \nhe left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage . \nthe widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless . \nshe also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) . \nwhat makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her . \neven though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures . \nher gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing . \nsince she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use . \nthe two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff . \nfor grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) . \nthe locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation . \nthe story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail . \nit is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail . \nthe scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity . \nthe film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity . \nthings work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood . \nthere are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded . \nthis 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute . \nummm !
